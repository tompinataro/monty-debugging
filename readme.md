Monty the Meddlesome Marsupial
===========

Our fictional client, Koala Holla, just completed a full-stack app dedicated to the ethical transitioning of koalas from the outdoors (whereupon they may be rained) to urban areas where roofs exist. 

Unfortunately, a koala named Monty was not _quite_ ready to handle the stresses of urban life. In a disturbing turn of events, Monty strong-armed his way into to the server room, and proceeded to hack into the client's github repo. We're not sure exactly what code he changed, but now the entire app is broken!

It is up to you to stop Monty the Meddlesome Marsupial, and fix all the bugs he added to the system.

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository and clone your fork onto your computer.
2. Install the project's node dependencies by navigating to the project and running the command `npm install`
3. Run `npm start` to start the application. Or at least, attempt to start the application 🐨 😈 🔥

## How to approach this assignment

There are a lot of bugs in here, and they may not all be obvious at first glance. Work on this in small pieces, making sure each step is fully working before you move on to the next. 

Note that there **may be multiple bugs** causing one thing to break. You may fix some code, only to find that the app is still breaking for other reasons.

## Get the App Up and Running

Your first step is to get the application up and running. It may sound obvious, but it's true. Sometimes you will be given code that won't run when you get it! This can be daunting. You will need to work through all you have learned about setting up jQuery, node, and express apps.

1. Setup your **database**. You may need to fix some bugs already! Double check the contents of your database in Postico, and make sure it's showing what you expect.
2. Get the **server** running. Keep an eye on your server logs, and address any immediate error messages before moving on.
3. Get the **client** running in a browser. Before anything else, check your browser console and server logs for errors.

## Test the Features

Congrats, you got the app to load 🎉 Now it's time to start testing all the **features** of the app:

1. Work your way one-by-one through all of the **CRUD** operations(create, read, update, delete). Can you add (create) a new koala item to the system? Can you view (read) all the correct information about that koala? Is the DOM correct?
2. When debugging, always start with your **error logs**! When you click a button, check both your client and server logs to see if it caused any errors. Fix these first!
3. Once the errors are fixed, move onto the app **behavior**. eg. if you submit the form, does a new item show up on the list? Does it display the correct values?


Bug hunting ain't easy, but remember --- you were BORN to squash bugs 🐛 🥾. Don't let that filthy marsupial get you down 💪

## Bug Reports

In addition to fixing up Monty's mess, Koala Holla has asked that you file reports describing some of the bugs (they will need these for the insurance claims!) 

Pick two or three bugs, and fill out bug reports for them as you work through the problem:

- [bug-report-1.md](./bug-report-1.md)
- [bug-report-2.md](./bug-report-2.md)
- [bug-report-3.md](./bug-report-3.md)

## Reflections on Debugging

> **WAIT** to complete this section until you hear from your instructor.

In your pods, discuss the following questions. When you're finished with your discussion, nominate one person from your pod to share a few thoughts with the cohort.

- Which methods of debugging worked best for you?
- What else works for you?
- What's the hardest part for you?
- Could code have been written in a different way, that would have made debugging easier?
